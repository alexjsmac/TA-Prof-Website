This project was created by Alex MacLean and William Callaghan.

Note: This project uses Twitter Bootstrap for styling. The files located in /fonts,  /css and /js
are Twitter Bootstrap files. Bootstrap is also used throughout our php files for styling.

Please note the following:

1) This application will only work with the database amacle45tadb because of naming conventions.

2) This application contains an additional table in the database then that in assignment 2.
This table is called "administration". The attached two script files are the first two script
files from assignment 2 with the addition of the "administration" table and the entry with
Janice's login credentials.

These credentials are:
Login: janice
Password: janice

Currently, adding and deleting administration users can only occur through mysql commands.

3) If you are not logged in or try viewing a page you do not have permission, you will be
redirected to the login screen.

3a) Password is stored and validated in plain-text because no encryption requirements were given
in the project specification.

4) This application uses cookies and session authentication.
