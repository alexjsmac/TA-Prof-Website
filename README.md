# TA-Prof-Website
Created by Alex MacLean and William Callaghan.

This project uses Twitter Bootstrap for styling. The files located in /fonts, /css and /js
are Twitter Bootstrap files. Bootstrap is also used throughout our php files for styling.

The application will only work with the database `amacle45tadb` because of naming conventions.

The secretary credentials are:
Login: janice
Password: janice

Currently, adding and deleting admin users can only be done with in from within the database.

If you are not logged in, or try viewing a page you do not have permission for, you will be
redirected to the login screen.

The password is stored and validated in plain-text because no encryption requirements were given
in the project specification.

This application uses cookies and session authentication.
